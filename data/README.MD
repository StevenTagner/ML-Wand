# Data - Gestures and non Gestures

The data will be gathered in two groups -

* Gesture
  * To start, this dataset will be 50 samples of the proper gesture gathered with the Arduino Board.
* Non-Gesture
  * To start, this will be a collection of 50 samples of non-gesture data to provide something for the model to compare the proper data against.

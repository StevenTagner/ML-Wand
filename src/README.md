# ML Wand - Steven Tagner

## This file is currently code I had from a project in my ML Class - I am waiting on getting the board in the mail so I can start gathering data and running tests, as such the code will not run at the moment and all the markdown comments are written as predictions/plans rather than comments on active code.

I will be testing several different models in an attempt to discover which works best for this situation. I will start with logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models and compare them. I may look into trying new model types depending on how these do but there are no plans for that at the moment

I will be updating this readme once I am able to collect data and run test.
